# Daily-Code-Challenges

This repo contains code in C++ for the Daily Code Problems.The problems are divided into groups of 4 problems each.

Problems Description List

1 Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.Folder - Problems 1-4.
This problem is solved using 2 approaches.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

2 Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
